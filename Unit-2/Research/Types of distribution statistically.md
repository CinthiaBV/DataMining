## Distributions that exist statistically

> Diaz Urias Francisco Javier

Bernoulli distribution

It consists of carrying out a random experiment only once and observing whether a certain event occurs or not, where p is the probability that this is the case (success) and q = 1-p the probability that it is not (failure). In reality it is not more than one that can only take two modalities, that is why the fact of calling the possible results of the result tests success or failure. We could therefore define this experiment by means of a v.a. discrete X that takes the values ​​X = 0 if the event does not occur, and X = 1 otherwise.

Binomial distribution

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that measures the number of successes in a sequence of n independent BERNOULLI trials, with a fixed probability p of occurrence of success between trials. • There are many situations in which a binomial experience. Each of the experiments is independent of the rest (the probability of the result of one experiment does not depend on the result of the rest). The result of each experiment must admit only two categories (which are called success and failure). The probabilities of both possibilities must be constant in all the experiments (they are denoted as pyqopy 1-p). • The variable that measures the number of successes that have occurred in the n experiments is designated by X. • When they occur Under these circumstances, the variable X is said to follow a binomial probability distribution, and is denoted B (n, p)

Poisson distribution

It is a discrete model, but in which the set of values ​​with non-zero probability is not finite, but countable. • This distribution is usually used for counts of the number of individuals per unit of time, space, etc. • Properties from the Poisson model • 1) Expectation: E (X) = λ • 2) Variance: V (X) = λ • In this distribution, the expectation and the variance coincide.

Normal distribution

In statistics and probability, it is called a normal distribution, Gaussian distribution or Gaussian distribution, to one of the probability distributions of a continuous variable that most often appears approximate in real phenomena. • The graph of its density function has a bell shape and is symmetric with respect to a certain parameter. This curve is known as a Gaussian bell and is the graph of a Gaussian function.

Gamma distribution

In statistics the gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution with two parameters k and λ whose density function for values ​​x> 0 is • Here e is the number and and Γ is the gamma function. For values ​​the that is Γ (k) = (k - 1)! (the factorial of k - 1). In this case - for example to describe a Poisson process - they are called the Erlang distribution with a parameter θ = 1 / λ. • The expected value and the variance of a random variable X of gamma distribution are E * X + = k / λ = kθ V * X + = k / λ2 = kθ2.

Student distribution

In probability and statistics, the t (Student's) distribution is a probability distribution that arises from the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample size is small. It arises, in most practical statistical studies, when the standard deviation of a population is unknown and must be estimated from the data of a sample. • The t-Student test was developed in 1899 by the English chemist William Sealey Gosset (1876-1937), while working on quality control techniques for the Guinness distilleries in Dublin. Because at the distillery, his job was not initially that of a statistician and his dedication should be exclusively aimed at improving production costs, he published his findings anonymously by signing his articles with the name of "Student".
