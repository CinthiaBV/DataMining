Euclidean Distance

In mathematics, algebra, geometry, and more specifically in real analysis, complex analysis, and analytical geometry, it is a non-negative function used in various contexts to calculate the distance between two points, first in the plane and then in space. It is also used to define the distance between two points in other types of spaces of three or more dimensions. And to find the length of a segment defined by two points of a line, of the plane or of spaces of greater dimension.

Equation

The equation is simple, we take our coordinates from our points, we subtract, we subtract the values ​​(x2 - x1), we raise it to the square and we add the result of the operation of the second point (y2-y1) to the square, to finish we take the square root of the result .

KNN R

Within the kNN algorithm, the most used distance measures are: Euclidean distance, Minkowski distance, Manhattan distance, Cosine distance and Jaccard distance. These are not the only ones, the kNN algorithm can use any other measure of distance, although with these we will cover the vast majority of cases.

Euclidean Distance

The Euclidean distance is based on the Pythagorean theorem, according to which, the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of the squared legs.

This formula will work regardless of the number of variables there are. Starting from the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the distance in a straight line between two points, that is, the Euclidean distance. In the following image we can see how the distance between points p and q would be calculated.

Thus, since the Euclidean distance is one of the possible distance measures that the kNN algorithm can use.
